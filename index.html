    <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">About Me</h2>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      I have always considered myself a modern nomad. My eternal search for home has taken me to places I never knew existed. My missionary ancestors and mother from another country might be the reason for this eager to explore. When I found photography as a way to meet people and see places, I found a way to get closer to home.
      <br><br>
      Malmö is my hometown, and I live here with my partner and our adopted cat. The multicultural vibe here makes me feel I’m always travelling in a way. And when I really have to fly off, Copenhagen Airport is just 20 minutes away. I love food (who doesn’t?) and Malmö surely delivers. Whether we feel like having Indian food in a restaurant or cook it at home, all you need is just outside the door. As a vegetarian, there are many tasty choices. Whenever I find the time, I’m always up for a night out dancing. If I rather want to do daytime dancing, I just take a dance class. As long as my body is grooving, I’m happy.
      <br><br>
      With a passion for communication, a creative career has always been a natural choice for me. After receiving a diploma in graphic design from Berghs SoC in Stockholm and a year of communication studies in Melbourne, Australia, I decided to work as a graphic designer within advertising. In 2015, I started my own business in photography. Photography started as a way to express myself, and after years of documenting, I got to the point where I found photography more important than just my own memories. I wanted to share it with others.
      <br><br>
      I believe my typical customer is someone who really appreciates the art of photography. When it comes to wedding customers, I want to become a good friend and help you remember the little things that surround your day. Mostly, I will be in the background, quietly documenting. During portrait sessions, I really want you to relax and enjoy the time. Sometimes I can give you instructions and be specific, and it’s all part of the fun. I get many ideas while I’m in my creative buzz, and I always welcome you to feel the same. We will simply become a team, enjoying a good time.
